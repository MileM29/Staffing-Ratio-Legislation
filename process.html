    <p>I researched the map by using <a href="https://nursa.com/blog/rn-to-patient-staffing-ratios">
        "RN Nurse-to-Patient Ratios by State"</a> as a starting point.
        From there, I used various state legislation websites to verify the information, which are linked in the map.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The website was created with a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS).
        HTML is used to describe the elements of the website, including text, images, and links.
        CSS is used for styling HTML.
        With CSS I added borders, margins, and specified fonts, but chose to keep the site simple.</p>
    <br>
    <p>JS is used to add interactivity to the website.
        This posed the biggest challenge in making this website, as it required extensive research as well as trial and error.
        I started by researching various JS libraries that would allow me to create interactive data.
        I looked into <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3js</a> for a time, but found it to be too advanced for my
        first website, and potentially overkill. I also looked into <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/">Charts.js</a> but
        scrapped the idea when I decided that an interactive map would be my focus. I ultimately settled on <a href="https://leafletjs.com/index.html">Leaflet</a>
        due to its simple implementation and close fit to my needs.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I started by following the <a href="https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/">quick start tutorial</a>
        for Leaflet, followed by the <a href="https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/">chloropleth map tutorial.</a>
    I used the GeoJSON data provided by Leaflet to create an interactive overlay of the individual states. GeoJSON is a data format
        that allows you to store and display geographic data with custom parameters.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        In addition to the display data provided by Leaflet, the custom parameters I used were "State," "Staffing #," and "Staffing policy description."
        "Staffing #" is a numerical description of the staffing policy, used to assign colors to the map, as shown in the map key.
        "Staffing description" is what the user sees when they hover over a state. In addition, I added a parameter containing a URL of each state's
        policy (if it exists).
