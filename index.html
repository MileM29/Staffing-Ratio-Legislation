        <h2>What does staffing policy mean for patients?</h2>
        <p>    - Every additional patient a nurse takes on carries an additional <a href="https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(20)31038-5/fulltext">12% odds of in-patient mortality</a>. </p> <br>
        <p>    - Higher staffing levels are associated with <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-6773.2010.01114.x">improved patient outcomes</a>, including reduced mortality and fewer failure-to-rescue events. </p> <br>
        <p>    - Strong staffing levels can <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002074892100033X?via%3Dihub">reduce patient lengths of stay</a>, lowering system-wide costs while improving overall quality of care. </p> <br>

    <h2>What are the pros and cons of different staffing policy approaches?</h2>
    <p>    - Because of the ubiquity of the above evidence against poor staffing, all approaches aim to decrease nursing workloads. </p> <br>
    <p>    - Mandatory ratios aim to directly combat poor staffing by forcing hospitals to keep a baseline ratio of nurses to patients.
        States like California and Oregon have had success in implementing ratios in every unit, while states like New York and Arizona have limited ratios to ICUs.
    Oftentimes, mandatory ratios face strong opposition due to the perceived inflexibility of their solution. With that being said, mandatory ratios have the strongest evidence
    of success, with California <a href="https://www.nursingoutlook.org/article/S0029-6554(21)00230-X/abstract">outpacing non-ratio states</a> in amount of direct nursing care per patient since implementation in 2004.</p> <br>
    <p>    - Committee based approaches are a middle ground solution seeking to put staffing in the hands of nurses.
    In theory, nursing workloads can be reduced via smart allocation of patients based on nurse experience, patient acuity, and availability of
    support staff. Therefore, through purposeful allocation, hospitals retain the option to tweak ratios during acute increases in patient
    volume, while making strides to decrease workloads through other means. While this approach works well on paper, this approach is
    less proven than mandatory ratios. While there is some evidence that staffing can go up in hospitals using a staffing committee, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nuf.12594">the qualitative evidence tying this to legislation is lacking.</a> </p> <br>
